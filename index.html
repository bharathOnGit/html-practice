    <h1>Hello</h1>

    <p>
        so this is just for html although. have used a bit of css right now thats only to ease my eyes thats it!
        from here on wards we are learning only the html and next we can start css and js along the way and probably
        learn inclusion of <abbr title="DataBases">DB's</abbr>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Now talking abt the main goal in learning web dev <br>
        I wanted to learn bits of ai but in orde to create it we need to process information from internet and one of
        the first proect i want to do is to create a agentic ai that can be used to apply for multiple jobs with almost
        zero interaction or atleast atomate most of it for me. <br>
        in order to create it we need to scrap data from the internet websites and in order to do it i need to know how
        they are actually built so that i can make a working model that can actually scrap the data for me although this
        is going to be a big project for now lets see how it goes i might atleast scrap some ueful info from the internet
    </h3>

    <h2>
        I have this view on ai:
        &nbsp; So there is actually no way ai can be removed for now atleast unless we find it thinking for its own good.
        for now ai is going like a bubble compnaies that actually dont need it are actively trying to have it for dumb
        reasons such as banks having it for customer care although its not doing any damn thing and could leak data to
        its parent company. but this makes the bank look great compared to others.
        <br><br>
        <hr>
        now its not realy my concern or atleastfor now i want to cash on this ai bubble everyone is going nuts for,
        oneof the best ways is not to try reduce ai but rather try to make it run on as low resources as possible,
        i guess its called using minimal resources or whatever, as the tech becomes faster and fast the data is going
        to become larger and larger lol, there is literally no way we can actually stop with a good chip or the fastest
        chip cuz new tech emerges for it and it becomes obsolete in some time. so out goal is to learn ai at core in
        order to make the most out of this, we dont create it for now we need to learn how to minimize it for minimal
        resources on a large scale this is going to be pretty good like the <abbr title="wealth that errodes if used incorrectly">Golden goose</abbr>
